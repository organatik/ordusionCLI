      <h3>Staff Augmentation</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Remember the days companies used to have huge internal IT departments? The trend is cost reduction and companies are looking for ways to reduce the number of permanent IT staff. Lean and mean is now in vogue for IT infrastructure. Companies hire consultants and form teams to implement projects. Once the need is served a new team is formed with new set of skills for the next project. This model suits the ever changing technology terrain of IT well.
